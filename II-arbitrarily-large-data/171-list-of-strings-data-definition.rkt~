; A List-of-string is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons String List-of-string)

; String -> String
; produces the content of file f as a string 
(define (read-file f) ...)
 
; String -> List-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of strings, 
; one per line
(define (read-lines f) ...)
 
; String -> List-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of strings, 
; one per word
(define (read-words f) ...)
 
; String -> List-of-list-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of list of
; strings, one list per line and one string per word 
(define (read-words/line f) ...)
 
; The above functions consume the name of a file as a String
; argument. If the specified file does not exist in the 
; same folder as the program, they signal an error.
