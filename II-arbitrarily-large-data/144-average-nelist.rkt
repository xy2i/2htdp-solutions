;; Ex. 144: Will sum and how-many work for NEList-of-temperatures even
;; though they are designed for inputs from List-of-temperatures?
;; If you think they donâ€™t work, provide counter-examples.
;; If you think they would, explain why.
; They will work, because the set of NEList-of-temperatures
; is smaller than the set of List-of-temperatures.
; All inputs that are in NEList-of-temperatures are in List-of-temperatures,
; so any functions that works with the latter works with the former.
