# How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition

HtDP is an book that teaches an introduction to structured programming
to any reader. Focusing on the fundamentals of programming, it teaches both 
new programmers the fundamental programming techniques and rips out
bad habits from experienced programmers.

I personally recommend it to any undergrad students looking to get a good 
handle on good design techniques.

## Why read this? Why not SICP?

> Over the past few years, we have developed an alternative approach to teaching
the first course. We have translated the approach into a new text book, and we 
believe that it addresses SICPâ€™s failings along four dimensions. 
First, the book discusses explicitly how programs should be constructed. 
Second, to tame the complexity of programming, it defines a series of teaching 
languages based on Scheme that represent five distinct knowledge levels 
through which students pass during their first course. The levels correspond to 
the complexity of data definitions that the program design guidelines use. 
Third, the book uses exercises to reinforce the explicit guidelines on 
program design; few, if any, exercises are designed 
for the sake of domain knowledge. 
Finally, the book uses more accessible forms of domain knowledge than SICP.

## Structure of this repository

This repository contains solutions to most exercises, from my own reading of the book. Some trivial exercises, like questions on the fly, or making diagrams which I did by hand are not included.
Each file contains a solution for the particular exercices. For multi-part exercises, such as [Exercise 42 and up](https://www.htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html#%28part._.D.K._sec~3adesign-world%29), each 'part' of the exercise is included, and each file contains a fully runnable program.
